# Parts workstream — status (updated 2026-11-04)

Owns: parts entries and gap curation in `scraper/junkyard_scraper.py`
(`_GAP_MECH`, `_gap_rows`, `_GAP_GENERIC_KEYS`, per-model blocks),
`scraper/parts_overlay.json`, `scraper/PARTS_GAPS_2026-11.md`,
`scraper/test_parts_gaps.py`.

## Rules specific to this work

- Every row has a basis: pull cost = median of the category across the 30
  published yard price lists; band = conservative used-OEM anchor consistent
  with audited rows of the same category. Write the basis in PARTS_GAPS.
- Options are `option`-flagged. Coupe/hatch rows use `body`, AWD rows `drive`.
- No engines, transmissions, catalytic converters, key fobs, ignition coils.
- Generation-split models (Civic, Cherokee) replace the base entry: add rows
  after the split, on the generation entries.
- Match lists that share a dict must list every spelling (the "grand
  caravan" lesson: 3,240 cars went dark when one spelling was dropped).
- Run `python3 scraper/test_parts_gaps.py` and `test_vpic_fixes.py` after
  each change. Measure with `scraper/interchange_coverage.py` (cars with no
  entry; cars matching only generic rows).

## Done

- §1–10: Altima, Camry, Civic, Focus, Malibu, Escape, Equinox, Sentra,
  Corolla, Elantra (model-specific rows).
- §11 breadth: 101 mid-volume models get generic rows; feed spellings routed
  (Ram, C/K, Caravan, Malibu/Classic). No-entry share 8.9% → 3.7%.
- §12 enthusiast audit: WRX/Impreza, Miata, 4Runner, Tacoma, Cherokee XJ.
- Overlay merge is window-aware (same name skipped only when years overlap).
- §13 measured block (in progress, see PARTS_GAPS §13): measured with the
  generic-tier rule offline (`interchange_coverage.py` measures engine
  families, not generic-only). Before: no-entry 3.7%, generic-only 12.9%
  (43,010 cars). Done: Camry 1992–2001 (→ 12.3%).

## Next

1. When the daily email's "Most searched parts / cars (7 d)" has a week of
   data, curate the top searched cars that still match only generic rows.
2. Candidates already identified: Hyundai Accent, Buick LeSabre/LaCrosse,
   Kia Soul, 1990s Camry/Corolla years.
3. Re-measure after each block and append to PARTS_GAPS.
