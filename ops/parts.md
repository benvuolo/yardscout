# Parts workstream — status (updated 2026-11-04, §13–16 done)

Owns: parts entries and gap curation in `scraper/junkyard_scraper.py`
(`_GAP_MECH`, `_gap_rows`, `_GAP_GENERIC_KEYS`, per-model blocks),
`scraper/parts_overlay.json`, `scraper/PARTS_GAPS_2026-11.md`,
`scraper/test_parts_gaps.py`.

## Rules specific to this work

- Every row has a basis: pull cost = median of the category across the 30
  published yard price lists; band = conservative used-OEM anchor consistent
  with audited rows of the same category. Write the basis in PARTS_GAPS.
- Options are `option`-flagged. Coupe/hatch rows use `body`, AWD rows `drive`.
- No engines, transmissions, catalytic converters, key fobs, ignition coils.
- Generation-split models (Civic, Cherokee) replace the base entry: add rows
  after the split, on the generation entries.
- Match lists that share a dict must list every spelling (the "grand
  caravan" lesson: 3,240 cars went dark when one spelling was dropped).
- Run `python3 scraper/test_parts_gaps.py` and `test_vpic_fixes.py` after
  each change. Measure with `scraper/interchange_coverage.py` (cars with no
  entry; cars matching only generic rows).

## Done

- §1–10: Altima, Camry, Civic, Focus, Malibu, Escape, Equinox, Sentra,
  Corolla, Elantra (model-specific rows).
- §11 breadth: 101 mid-volume models get generic rows; feed spellings routed
  (Ram, C/K, Caravan, Malibu/Classic). No-entry share 8.9% → 3.7%.
- §12 enthusiast audit: WRX/Impreza, Miata, 4Runner, Tacoma, Cherokee XJ.
- Overlay merge is window-aware (same name skipped only when years overlap).
- §13 measured block (2026-11-04, PARTS_GAPS §13): Camry 1992–2001, Accent
  2000–17, LeSabre 1992–2005, LaCrosse 2005–16, Corolla 1993–2002, Soul
  2010–19, done in measured order. Generic-only cars 43,010 (12.9%) →
  35,451 (10.6%); no-entry unchanged 12,298 (3.7%). New rows are bounded
  per generation with `_per_gen` (the splitter skips pump/compressor/motor
  names). Rows without a stated basis were left out and listed per model.
- §14 (owner go-ahead): the 56 §1–12 gap-block rows whose "fits" crossed a
  generation (pump, compressor, fan, throttle body, sunroof, AWD units,
  crossbars, Focus/Equinox mirrors, Malibu BCM) are split per generation by
  `_bound_gap_rows_per_generation` (153 rows). Every car's matched parts
  are unchanged; coverage unchanged (3.7% / 10.6%). Test guards it.
- §15 (owner: "go on the 776 rows"): every remaining crossing row on a
  GENERATION_BREAKS model is split per generation by
  `_bound_rows_per_generation`, which runs after `_apply_platform_families`
  (running it earlier dropped interchange notes). 776 → 2,346 rows; per-car
  parts, bands and sharedWith identical; coverage unchanged. Test asserts
  no row on any GENERATION_BREAKS model crosses a break.

- §16 (owner: "start the next parts block"): Focus 2000–07, Explorer
  1991–2001, Compass 2007–16, Rio 2001–17, Century 1986–2005, Aveo 2004–11
  (new GENERATION_BREAKS 2007/2009), Passat 1998–2011, Lucerne 2006–11, done
  in measured order. Generic-only 35,451 (10.6%) → 28,433 (8.5%); no-entry
  unchanged 12,298 (3.7%). No car lost or changed an existing part.

## How to measure

`interchange_coverage.py` measures engine-family donors, not generic-only.
The generic-only count re-matches every distinct year/make/model in
`docs/data/inventory_live.json` with `js.match_vehicle` and applies
`mine_coverage_gaps.is_generic_only` (≈15 s). Use the miner only with
`--no-fetch`: its default run fetches eBay sold-listing pages, which
standing rule 2 forbids (flagged for the owner; the script was not changed
here, it is outside this workstream's files).

## Open for the owner

- Models without GENERATION_BREAKS entries keep whole-entry spans; adding
  breaks for more models would let the §15 pass bound them too.
- `mine_coverage_gaps.py` fetches eBay pages by default (rule 2). The hub
  added `--no-fetch` to `coverage-mine.yml` on 2026-11-04, so the monthly run
  no longer fetches. Still to do here: remove the fetch path from the script
  (or make no-fetch the only mode) and update its docstring.

## Next

1. Next block by generic-only cars: Kia Forte (582), Buick Regal (576),
   Hyundai Tucson (564), Kia Sportage (550), Kia Spectra (548), Subaru
   Legacy (538), Lincoln MKZ (507), Hyundai Elantra (498, the years outside
   the §2–10 rows).
2. Facelift windows that are not GENERATION_BREAKS years still let a few
   lamp rows span a facelift (Focus 2000–07 lamps over 2005, Compass
   headlights over 2011). Flagged in §16; add facelift breaks if wanted.
3. When the daily email's "Most searched parts / cars (7 d)" has a week of
   data, let it reorder the list. Re-measure after each model.
