# Ops hub — status (updated 2026-11-04)

This workstream stays in the long-running session because the scheduled
watches are bound to it. It does not build features.

## Live state

- **iOS 1.12.10 build 26**: submitted 2026-11-03 17:21 UTC, WAITING_FOR_REVIEW.
  Check: dispatch `asc-status.yml`.
- **Android 1.12.11 (33)**: Play production, status completed (Google review).
  Check: dispatch `play-status.yml`.
- **Web**: `main` deploys to GitHub Pages; sw cache `jh-v139`.
- **Scan**: `scan.yml` every 4 h, commits `docs/data/`. `model_lifespan.json`
  writer fixed after the 09:23 UTC run; expected from the 13:23 UTC run.
- **Daily ops email** 13:07 UTC (`backend/src/ops_monitor.js`): subscribers
  (Apple + Google from KV `ops:store-subs`, Stripe + comps from entitlement
  records), chain-frozen flags, review-prompt funnel, most-searched parts/cars.
- **Store subscriber count** `store-subscribers.yml` 12:41 UTC daily. Apple
  works (4 active on 11-02). Google stays blank until Google applies the
  service account's "View financial data" permission (owner granted it
  2026-11-03); the job retries daily.
