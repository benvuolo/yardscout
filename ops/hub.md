# Ops hub — status (updated 2026-11-04)

This workstream stays in the long-running session because the scheduled
watches are bound to it. It does not build features.

## Live state

- **iOS 1.12.10 build 26**: submitted 2026-11-03 17:21 UTC, WAITING_FOR_REVIEW.
  Check: dispatch `asc-status.yml`.
- **Android 1.12.11 (33)**: Play production, status completed (Google review).
  Check: dispatch `play-status.yml`.
- **Web**: `main` deploys to GitHub Pages; sw cache `jh-v139`.
- **Scan**: `scan.yml` every 4 h, commits `docs/data/`. GitHub skips crons
  often (12:00 and the hourly watchdog were skipped 2026-11-04); dispatch by
  hand when the last scan is over 5 h old.
- **model_lifespan.json** live since the 2026-11-04 15:54 scan: 638 models,
  193 yards, 2,382 yard+model figures, global median 61 d, 134 fast pairs.
  Open data issues (not yet assigned): long yard medians at Prestige Houston
  (296 d), San Antonio PnP (233 d), Wichita, Belton, Dallas South (likely
  stale feeds holding departed cars); model spellings split ("Dodge|Ram",
  "Dodge|RAM", "Dodge|Ram 1500"; "General Motors|ION"/"VUE" should be Saturn).
- **Daily ops email** 13:07 UTC (`backend/src/ops_monitor.js`): subscribers
  (Apple + Google from KV `ops:store-subs`, Stripe + comps from entitlement
  records), chain-frozen flags, review-prompt funnel, most-searched parts/cars.
- **Store subscriber count** `store-subscribers.yml` 12:41 UTC daily. Apple
  works (4 active on 11-02). Google stays blank until Google applies the
  service account's "View financial data" permission (owner granted it
  2026-11-03); the job retries daily.

## Scheduled tasks bound to this session

- `trig_019imiZ2pPN5QP6g5kuvcYYR` U-Pull-R reply watch, twice daily, Gmail
  thread `1a1a39a67c2ba6f8` (sales@upullrparts.com, jessef@upullrparts.com).
  Disable after 2026-11-14 if no reply.
- `trig_016qavfgFfYSVTGUH5ERmJuH` one-shot 14:27 UTC 2026-11-04: check
  `docs/data/model_lifespan.json` exists after the 13:23 scan.

- eBay developer keyset (`EBAY_CLIENT_ID`, `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` as repo
  secrets) and the Marketplace Insights access request.
